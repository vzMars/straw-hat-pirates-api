## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

I used Node.js and Express to build this API that contains the name, occupation, epithet, bounty, origin, age, devil fruit status, and capabilities of all the Straw Hat Pirates crew members. Calls made to this API will send a JSON response with the character’s information.

## Optimizations:

I would like to expand this API and add more endpoints that will allow users to get even more data from the One Piece series.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great project to practice using Node.js and Express and I was able to learn how to build a basic API and host it on Heroku. It’s pretty nice that this API can now be used by others to make apps of their own.
